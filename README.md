# timebot
Hello, I am timebot the friendly bot that figures out how long things take to do.

I am starting off with tasks for software.  feed me in the core details and I will crunch the data and try to figure out how long things are going to take.

Timebot is an experiment on 3 fronts 

1) To create a new kind of software based on the principals of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) using free market economics timebot will pay you for the information you submit to its API and will charge when you access its API.  It will use the balance of the 2 to pay for its servers, code updates and so on.  It will use bartering submit 1 get 2 and  will increase the access price based on demand. More information on DAO's can be found at the following URL  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization

2) To bring accurate estimates based on real world data for the first time to software development, everything is data driven but for some reason we do not do it with our code.  Once we have cracked data we can turn timebot on all the world's data

3) So the Author can learn a new stack.  This is my First Node.js and rethink app people so please  rip the code  to pieces.
